After using Vim as my default editor for about 2 years, I decide to switch to Emacs. There isn't any special reason for this migration. In fact, it's just becasue something kept agitating in my heart. I want to try some new stuff.
</p>
<p>
Obviously the learning curve of Emacs is very high. IMO even higher than Vim. After tried to learn Vim 2 years ago, I realized that the keypoint to master those heavy weapon is using them to destory some real targets. I've used Vim to code since 2 years ago and turned nearly every general key-bindings to the muscle memory. I want to replicate that process with Emacs and the famous <a href="http://orgmode.org">org-mode</a>.
</p>
<p>
Recently I opened a <a href="http://blog.ztap.net">blog</a> on <a href="http://pages.github.com">github pages</a> with <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. The Octopress is handy and the syntax of markdown is just similar to org-mode. So why not write blogs in org-mode and publish them with Octopress? After googled on the Internet, I found some nice articles to help me blogging with Octopress and org-mode.

So here comes my product. :)
